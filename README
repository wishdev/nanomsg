TLDR

An idiomatic nanomsg wrapper for Ruby. 

NANOMSG

nanomsg library is a high-performance implementation of several "scalability 
protocols". Scalability protocol's job is to define how multiple applications 
communicate to form a single distributed application. Implementation of 
following scalability protocols is available at the moment:

 * PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
 * BUS - simple many-to-many communication
 * REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
 * PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
 * FANIN - aggregates messages from multiple sources
 * FANOUT - load balances messages among many destinations
 * SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go

Scalability protocols are layered on top of transport layer in the network 
stack. At the moment, nanomsg library supports following transports:

 * INPROC - transport within a process (between threads, modules etc.)
 * IPC - transport between processes on a single machine
 * TCP - network transport via TCP

SYNOPSIS

  require 'nanomsg'

  socket1 = NanoMsg::PairSocket.new
  socket1.bind('inproc://test')
  
  socket1.send('test')
  socket1.recv

STATUS

Works with a range of nanomsg versions, last one verified is 0.6. Should work
for mri rubies 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.

Beta software: If you know what you're doing, you can use this in production.
